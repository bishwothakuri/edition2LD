                    <term ref="1997">Uprānta</term>: While -2-<note place="end">The name of the referent of
                  this number is missing; it could be on the back side of the document.</note> went
               to take a bath during the eclipse, <persName n="12">Kahaluryā Rājā</persName> brought
               to me this news: it has transpired that [between] two thousand to twenty-five hundred
               soldiers of <persName n="13">Raṇajit Siṃ</persName> were lost in an attack upon
                    <placeName n="14">Bharama Gaḍha</placeName> in <placeName n="15">Kashmir</placeName>. Having encountered many difficulties, the troops are
               withdrawing. These days Raṇajit Siṃ has been going from temporary lodging
                  (                    <foreign>ḍerā</foreign>) of his cannoneers and soldiers, and telling that he
               would provide <term ref="891">birtā</term> to some, [between] 5 to 7 thousand rupees
               to others, and increase the pay (<term ref="1821">darmāha</term>) to still others if
               they take Kashmir [for him]. If it is done this Śrāvaṇa [or in the following month,]
               Bhādra [months], it is done; if not it will be difficult [for him] to take. This was
               the news conveyed [to me]. After Rāṇajit Siṃ attacked Kashmir, the house of <persName n="16">Kāvela</persName>
                    <note place="end"> Perhaps the residence of <persName n="24">E.B. Cowell</persName>.
                    </note> was also restored. It is reported that
                    <persName n="17">Phatte Khā̃</persName>'s troops have also come to Kashmir.
               Whatever news comes hereafter, I will report [to you] in writing.
