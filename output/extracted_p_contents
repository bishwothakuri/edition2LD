We have evidence of privately financed cakras among the\n               Yogīs at the Kāṣṭhamaṇḍapa in Kathmandu from the 15th century\n                  onward,According to Unbescheid (1980: 67, 113) a copperplate\n                  issued in 1379 CE (see K_0055_0005) ordered the Darśana(dhārīs) to perform the\n                     gaṇapūjā (=cakrapūjā) at the\n                  Kāṣṭhamaṇḍapa. This assertion, which caused some confusion (see Bouillier 1993: 86 n. 20), cannot be confirmed. The first\n                  reference to an annual cakra among the Yogīs there is found\n                  only later, in a copperplate issued in 1465 CE which commemorates the donation of\n                  9 ropanīs of land made by one\n                     Caitanyanātha, a Yogī from Gauḍa\n                     Deśa (a kingdom in the region of modern-day\n                     Bengal), to the venerable avadhūtas\n                  (see K_0055_0004). Other donations for a yogīcakra at the\n                  Kāṣṭhamaṇḍapa followed in 1485 CE (see K_0054_0057) and 1512 CE (see\n                  K_0055_0001). and in the 17th century the Patan king Śrīnivāsa\n                  Malla, who adopted Avalokiteśvara-Karuṇamaya of\n                  Buṅga as his tutelary deity and made the god's annual\n               procession a state ritual,Locke 1980:\n                  308 n. 68, 414-415 financed a “jogīcakraguthi” at the\n               Rāto Machindranātha temple at Ta Bahā in\n                  Patan in the name of his mother\n                  Bhānumatī.A long stone inscription dated NS\n                  793 (1673 CE) which regulated many details of the cult of the deity lists the\n                  plots of land assigned to this guṭhī, which was established to\n                  supply the jogīcakra with food after the ghaṭasthāpana on the new moon day of Caitra (D.R.\n                     Regmi 1966: 156; Tevārī, Rāmajī et al. VS\n                     2020: 10 and Locke 1980: 311). King Pṛthvīnārāyaṇa's support of\n               the cakra was on a bigger scale. Soon after his conquest of the\n               Kathmandu Valley he issued this lālamohara from his new\n               residence, Kāntīpura (Kathmandu), and assigned land to finance no fewer than four\n               such pūjās in different places. Among these rituals is the\n               so-called \"Great cakrapūjā\"\n                  (mahācakrapūjā),See note 29. which was\n               supported by a major grant of 55 (or in the corrected version, 53)\n                  ropanīs of land. When Unbescheid conducted his fieldwork in the\n               late 1970s, this ritual marked the beginning of a cycle of altogether 34\n                  cakrapūjās performed in different localities, and usually\n               linked with the beginning of a procession of the local deity.Concerning these pūjās, see Unbescheid 1980: 117-127; see also\n                  Locke 1980: 442 n. 105. According to Unbescheid, the widespread performance\n               of these pūjās throughout the whole Valley represented an\n               important factor when it came to projecting power. Without the Yogīs’\n                  pūjās the other rituals could not start (Unbescheid 1980: 114).\n               But Unbescheid also observed signs of decline in the 20th century. Fields were lost\n               and rituals had to be cancelled.He gives as examples the\n                     pūjās terminated at the Kāṣṭhamaṇḍapa and in\n                     Deopatan (Unbescheid 1980: 115)."
